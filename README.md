# US_Shootings_Analysis
An analysis with an aim of gaining insights from a United states dataset on the police shootings.



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We came accross a dataset that had detailed information about police shootings in the US betweent the years 2015 and 2020. Following the social unrest in the US in the year 2020. It was alleged that human rights in the US are being undermined by Police through brutality.

The team and I then came to a consensus to try and find out some of the common and underlying factors that lead to the police resulting to shoot their victims.

We also seeked to identify trends over the time period 2015 - 2020, yearly , mothly and weekly

We came accross some very interesting facts.

Here's a snipet:
* Did you know that more White people than all the other races combined are shot by the police in the UNITED STATES? :neutral_face::neutral_face:
* Did you know majority of the police shootings occur in the state of Carlifonia :anguished: :anguished:
* Women account for less than 5% of all police shooting civilian cases in the US :hushed::hushed:
* The youngest person shot and killed was just 6 years old. :anguished: :anguished::anguished: :anguished:
* There's more tea where that came from follow us for more

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

We did this analysis with the intention of identifying trends, causing factors and correlations within the dataset with the intention to inform public policy makers to make more informed decisions on police reforms


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Following our analysis we identified some gaps in the data and would like to continue improving the dashboard and analysis in order to come up with a better scope of what is happening in the US.
Some of the data that would have been nice to have are

1. Why the suspect was being arrested
2. Information about all the arrests that have occured
3. Inforamtion about police shoootings post the BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT
4. All data regarding police brutality and arrests are welcome
5. Similar datasets for police brutality or killings in Kenya or Africa at large
